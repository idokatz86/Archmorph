# Archmorph

**AI-Powered Multi-Cloud Architecture Translator & Migration Platform**

Translate AWS and GCP architecture diagrams into Azure-ready migration artifacts: service mappings, guided questions, IaC drafts, HLD exports, cost estimates, Architecture Package HTML/SVG deliverables, and reviewable migration packages. Archmorph is in preview/stabilization; some enterprise surfaces are implemented as beta or scaffolded workflows.

## Overview

Archmorph is an AI-assisted cloud migration workbench. The live path analyzes uploaded architecture diagrams, maps AWS/GCP services to Azure equivalents with confidence scoring, asks guided migration questions, generates IaC drafts, prepares HLD/report exports, exports customer-facing Architecture Package HTML/SVG views, and estimates costs. The application is 100% free for customers: there are no subscriptions, paid tiers, billing steps, or hidden customer charges. Adjacent platform capabilities such as scanner, deploy, collaboration, gallery, and drift are present in the codebase at varying maturity levels and are labeled below so operators know what is ready to trust.

### Capability Status

| Status | Meaning | Capabilities |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Live | Usable in the current product path | Diagram upload, sample playground, AI service mapping, guided questions, IaC/HLD/report export, **Architecture Package HTML/SVG export**, cost estimates, service catalog freshness health, admin health/release evidence, auth shell, CI/security scanning |
| Beta | Implemented but needs hardening, deeper tests, or production validation | Cost/token observability, collaboration, gallery, replay, Terraform state import, multi-cloud cost comparison, **Azure Landing Zone target diagram** (visual scaffold; production-ready push targeted for v4.3.0 under epic #586 — see [Production-Ready Roadmap](#production-ready-roadmap-azure-landing-zone-v430-target) below) |
| Scaffold | UI/routes/models exist, but execution needs integration or operator review | Live cloud scanner, deploy engine, credential vault |
| Planned | Not production-ready yet | VS Code extension, PR-based IaC workflow, multi-diagram projects |

### Production-Ready Roadmap — Azure Landing Zone (v4.3.0 target)

The post-merge CTO end-to-end review of `landing-zone-svg` (May 1, 2026) flagged the feature as **demo-ware** rather than production-ready. We're keeping it visibly Beta and shipping a 19-issue production-readiness push under epic [#586](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/586) to flip it to **Live** at end of Sprint 3:

| Track | Issues | Goal |
|-------|--------|------|
| **T2→T3 fidelity** (technical debt) | [#587](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/587)–[#594](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/594) | Icon registry/security hardening (D1) completed; remaining work covers tier mis-bucketing (D2), data-driven templates (D3), `service_connections` wiring (D4), mappings staleness, test guardrails, golden-file regression, CI freshness lint |
| **Observability + perf** | [#595](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/595), [#597](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/597) | OTel spans + metrics + alerts; SLO p95 < 1.5 s primary / < 3 s DR; Locust soak 100 RPS × 5 min |
| **Security + a11y + API** | [#596](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/596), [#598](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/598), [#599](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/599) | OWASP API Top 10 pass, WCAG 2.1 AA + screen-reader semantics, locked OpenAPI 3.1 contract + 90-day deprecation policy |
| **Frontend exposure** | [#601](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/601) (closes [#575](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/575)) | ExportHub option + `LandingZoneViewer` with DR toggle, pan/zoom, deep-link state |
| **Quality assurance** | [#600](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/600), [#604](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/604) | Golden PDF regression suite (AWS/GCP/mixed/CTO-redacted); GA gate re-runs CTO E2E with `gpt-5-pro` rubric judge |
| **Foundry model evaluation** | [#602](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/602), [#781](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/781) | Benchmark candidate model lanes against the current `gpt-4.1` primary and `gpt-4o` fallback. #781 delivered a deployment-aware plan and explicitly keeps production routing unchanged until live availability, quota, safety, and quality gates pass. |
| **Docs + release** | [#603](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/603), [#605](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/605) | Customer-facing "What is the ALZ diagram?" doc + sample gallery; Beta → Live promotion + v4.3.0 release |

**GA gate ([#604](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/604))**: re-run the same PDF that produced the original demo-ware verdict. Pass requires icon hit rate ≥ 95%, all 8 tiers populated, ≥ 3 `service_connections` rendered, golden-file pixel diff < 2%, SLO budgets met, CISO sign-off, and `gpt-5-pro` judge returning `production-ready`. Anything less and Sprint 4 absorbs fix-forward — we don't ship.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Upload architecture diagrams (PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF, Draw.io, Visio) or import existing IaC (Terraform/ARM/CloudFormation)
- **Cloud Scanner scaffold** — AWS/Azure/GCP scan routes and wizard are present; production credential flow and provider validation still need hardening
- **Deploy scaffold** — generated IaC can be reviewed; direct deployment/rollback paths are not treated as production-ready yet
- Auto-detect AWS/GCP services with AI vision across a **405+ service catalog** (145 AWS, 143 Azure, 117 GCP — grows automatically)
- **Guided migration questions** — 32 contextual questions across 8 categories with **inter-question constraint system** that dynamically filters options based on compliance and data residency choices
- Map to Azure equivalents with **confidence scores and transparency explanations** showing why each level was assigned
- **Export Architecture Package** as polished customer-facing HTML plus target/DR SVG renderings with Azure topology views, talking points, and limitations
- **Export classic architecture diagrams** as Excalidraw, Draw.io, or Visio with Azure stencils
- **Azure Landing Zone target diagram** (Beta) — pure-stdlib `landing-zone-svg` export rendering a Microsoft-style hub-and-spoke ALZ (management groups, identity hub, network hub, ingress/compute/data/observability/storage/identity tiers) plus an optional `dr_variant=dr` view with region pairing and replication bands. Multi-source provider: works for both `source_provider=aws` and `source_provider=gcp` (provider read implicitly from the analysis payload). All icons embedded as `data:` URIs — no external network calls. T3 fidelity follow-ups tracked under epic #586.
- **Interactive Architecture Map** — dagre auto-layout with confidence rings, effort badges, typed edges, zone grouping, and full pan/zoom/drag interactivity
- **Service Dependency Graph** — React Flow interactive graph with 6 typed edges (traffic/database/auth/control/security/storage), dagre layout, click-to-reveal detail panel, SVG export
- **Email notifications** — Azure Communication Services integration for migration report delivery
- Generate Terraform HCL or Bicep code with secure credential handling and **8-rule IaC security scanning**
- **Dynamic cost estimates** — region-aware pricing via Azure Retail Prices API with 46 service mappings and monthly cache
- **Cost & Token Observability** — per-execution token metering, budget management with alerts, timeseries analytics, CSV export
- **Cost comparison** — side-by-side AWS/GCP vs Azure cost analysis with optimization recommendations
- **Migration Timeline Generator** — 7-phase migration plan with dependency ordering (topological sort), parallel workstreams, export as JSON/Markdown/CSV
- **Self-updating service catalog** — daily auto-discovery and auto-integration of new cloud services with fuzzy matching and category classification
- **AI cross-cloud mapping suggestions** — GPT-powered mapping with few-shot learning, auto-approve at 0.9 confidence, admin review queue
- **Icon Registry** — 405 normalized cloud service icons with Draw.io, Excalidraw, and Visio library builders; custom pack upload/delete requires an admin bearer session from `/api/admin/login`, is SVG-sanitized, generation-aware, and bounded without evicting built-in provider icons
- **AI-powered HLD generation** — 13-section High-Level Design documents with WAF assessment
- **HLD document export** — download HLD as Word (.docx), PDF, or PowerPoint (.pptx) with branded formatting
- **Full analysis PDF report** — 6-section branded report (cover, summary, mappings, costs, risks, IaC appendix)
- **IaC Chat assistant** — interactive GPT-4o assistant for code modifications
- **Chatbot assistant** — FAQ support and GitHub issue creation with intent detection
- **Migration intelligence** — ML-powered analysis with historical pattern matching
- **Infrastructure import** — import existing Terraform/ARM/CloudFormation configurations
- **Terraform State Import** — reverse-engineer existing infrastructure from tfstate/CloudFormation/ARM into architecture diagrams
- **Multi-Cloud Cost Comparison** — side-by-side Azure vs AWS vs GCP TCO analysis with savings recommendations
- **Auth shell** — simple login/logout/provider routes remain; SSO/SAML/SCIM, org, and profile routers were removed from the active API surface during main-branch convergence
- **Real-time Collaboration** — multi-stakeholder migration workspace with share codes and role-based participants
- **Migration Replay** — animated analysis timeline for presentations with playback controls

- **Admin dashboard** — runtime health, release gate view, audit stream, scheduled-job freshness, and guarded feature flag controls
- **Persistent analytics** — Azure Blob Storage with background flush and crash-safe shutdown
- **Toast notification system** — non-blocking success/error/warning notifications with auto-dismiss
- **Session expiry warning** — countdown banner with session extension capability
- **Browser close protection** — `beforeunload` guard prevents accidental data loss during analysis

## Quick Start

### Full-Spine CLI Run

Start with the engineer path when the backend is running locally or in production. This uploads a diagram, analyzes it, emits IaC, exports the Azure Landing Zone SVG, estimates cost, and writes deterministic artifacts without opening the browser.

```bash
archmorph run \
    --diagram ./fixtures/aws.png \
    --target-rg rg-platform-prod \
    --emit terraform,bicep,alz-svg,cost \
    --out ./infra
```

Artifacts are written as `analysis.json`, `terraform/main.tf`, `bicep/main.bicep`, `alz.svg`, `cost-estimate.json`, and `run-summary.json`. See [docs/CLI_USAGE.md](docs/CLI_USAGE.md) for API configuration, drift baseline comparison, and GitHub PR push examples.

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription
- Azure CLI installed
- Terraform 1.5+
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.12+

### Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
cd infra
az login
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

### Run Locally

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Docker Compose (full stack):**
```bash
docker compose up -d   # PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7 + Backend + Frontend
```

**Production-parity local guard mode:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.parity.yml up --build
```

This overlay keeps everything local, but starts the backend with production-like persistence guards:
`ENVIRONMENT=production`, `ENFORCE_POSTGRES=true`, `REQUIRE_REDIS=true`, PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`, Redis via `REDIS_URL`, and Gunicorn/Uvicorn workers instead of the reload server.

**Production Architecture Package smoke:**
Run the manual `Production Architecture Package Smoke` GitHub Action, or run [docs/PRODUCTION_SMOKE_ARCHITECTURE_PACKAGE.md](docs/PRODUCTION_SMOKE_ARCHITECTURE_PACKAGE.md) locally, before release sign-off on changes to the live value spine. The smoke captures health freshness, sample analysis, guided answers, IaC, HLD, cost, Architecture Package HTML/SVG exports, and one classic diagram export as release evidence.

**Refresh the API contract snapshot after intentional backend route/schema changes:**
```bash
cd backend
python export_openapi.py > openapi.snapshot.json
python check_openapi_contract.py
```

### Step-by-Step Flow

```
Input (Upload / Scan / Import) → AI Analysis → Guided Questions → Collaboration → Deliverables (IaC / HLD / Cost / Deploy)
```

**Phase 1 — Input** (choose one or more entry points):
1. **Upload Diagram** — PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF, Draw.io (.drawio), or Visio (.vsdx) architecture diagram
2. **Import IaC** — Upload existing Terraform state (v3/v4), CloudFormation template, or ARM deployment JSON
3. **Cloud scan scaffold** — Connectors and credential-handling model exist, but live tenant scanning stays gated until provider validation is complete
4. **Demo Playground** — Try with sample diagrams, no sign-up required
5. **AI Vision Analysis** — GPT-4.1 detects services, connections, and annotations (with TTL cache)

**Phase 2 — Analysis** (collaborative, real-time):
6. **Guided Questions** — 8–18 contextual questions refine migration (SKU, compliance, networking, DR, security, region) with inter-question constraints
7. **Service Mappings** — Multi-cloud mappings with confidence scores and transparency explanations
8. **Dependency Graph** — Interactive React Flow canvas with 6 typed edges and dagre layout
9. **Migration Chat** — GPT-4o Q&A advisor for migration questions

## Self-Updating Service Catalog

The service catalog automatically discovers and integrates new cloud services:

- **Daily sync** — APScheduler runs at 2:00 AM UTC, fetching from AWS Pricing Index, Azure Retail Prices API, and GCP Pricing Calculator
- **Auto-integration** — newly discovered services are written directly into the Python catalog files under an `AUTO-DISCOVERED` section
- **Fuzzy matching** — normalised comparison (name, fullName, id) prevents false-positive detections
- **Category classification** — 55 keyword hints auto-assign categories (Compute, Storage, Database, AI/ML, etc.) and matching icons
- **Dry-run mode** — CLI `--dry-run` flag detects without writing
- **Tracking** — cumulative `auto_added` counts per provider in `service_updates.json`

### CLI Usage

```bash
cd backend
python service_updater.py --run-now     # Discover + auto-add
python service_updater.py --dry-run     # Discover only (no file writes)
```

## Service Catalog

**405+ total services** across three providers, with 122 verified cross-cloud mappings.

### AWS → Azure (Sample)

| AWS | Azure | Confidence |
|-----|-------|------------|
| EC2 | Virtual Machines | 95% |
| S3 | Blob Storage | 95% |
| Lambda | Azure Functions | 90% |
| RDS | Azure SQL / PostgreSQL Flexible | 90% |
| DynamoDB | Cosmos DB | 85% |
| EKS | AKS | 90% |

### GCP → Azure (Sample)

| GCP | Azure | Confidence |
|-----|-------|------------|
| Compute Engine | Virtual Machines | 95% |
| Cloud Storage | Blob Storage | 95% |
| Cloud Functions | Azure Functions | 90% |
| GKE | AKS | 90% |
| BigQuery | Synapse Analytics | 80% |

Full mapping database: 405+ services across AWS, Azure, and GCP with 122 mappings.

## Architecture Limitations Engine

Deterministic rule engine that flags structurally invalid Azure compositions during analysis — for example, an SFTP client connecting to Azure Storage's SFTP endpoint **through Azure Front Door** (Front Door is HTTP/HTTPS only and cannot tunnel SSH). The diagram and Terraform would deploy cleanly; the runtime traffic would never connect.

- 42 curated rules across 12 categories (protocol, network-topology, sku-prereq, identity-auth, data-plane, region, tier-feature, resilience, security, governance, operations, cost)
- YAML-driven rule library at [`backend/data/architecture_rules.yaml`](backend/data/architecture_rules.yaml); override via `ARCHMORPH_ARCH_RULES_PATH`
- Three severities: `blocker` (IaC will be wrong), `warning` (works but has gaps), `info` (best-practice nudges)
- IaC generation refuses with `409` when blockers exist; pass `?force=true` to override
- Full design + extensibility guide: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md)

## Cost Estimation

Dynamic pricing powered by the [Azure Retail Prices API](https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices):

- **Region-aware** — prices fetched per the user's selected deployment region (20 regions, default: West Europe)
- **SKU strategy multipliers** — Cost-optimized (0.65x), Balanced (1.0x), Performance-first (1.6x), Enterprise (2.2x)
- **46 service mappings** with built-in fallback estimates
- **Monthly cache** — prices cached to disk for 30 days
- **Per-service breakdown** — low/high range for each Azure service plus total monthly estimate

## Deployment

Deployment is automated through GitHub Actions from `main` to production. Keep cloud credentials and deployment values in GitHub Secrets; do not commit secrets or local `terraform.tfvars` values.

Before promoting a build, use the release checklist in [docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).

Production hardening switches:

- `DATABASE_URL` must point to PostgreSQL for production; set `ENFORCE_POSTGRES=true` to fail startup if SQLite is accidentally configured.
- `REDIS_HOST` or `REDIS_URL` should be configured for horizontal scale; set `REQUIRE_REDIS=true` to fail startup instead of falling back to local file-backed stores.
- `FEATURE_FLAG_LIVE_CLOUD_SCANNER` and `FEATURE_FLAG_DEPLOY_ENGINE` default to disabled and must only be enabled after the admin release gate and tenant validation pass.

### Azure Resources

| Resource | SKU | Region |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Container Apps (`archmorph-api`, `archmorph-mcp-gateway`) | Consumption | West Europe |
| Static Web Apps | Free | West Europe |
| Container Registry (`archmorphacm7pd`) | Basic | West Europe |
| Azure OpenAI | S0 | West Europe [^1] |
| PostgreSQL Flexible Server | Burstable B1ms | West Europe |
| Azure Cache for Redis | Basic C0 | West Europe |
| Application Insights | — | West Europe |

[^1]: #607 cut production traffic over to the West Europe account `archmorph-openai-we-acm7pd` with `gpt-4.1` primary and `gpt-4o` fallback. The prior East US account remains online during the rollback/zero-traffic verification window. The April 2026 hub used to also run an `archmorph-backend` App Service (Canada Central), a duplicate `cafd43cfd4deacr` registry (East US), and a stray `secondnature-openai-whisper` cognitive account. All three were retired during the May 2026 infra consolidation; the dev RG now hosts only the active Container Apps stack and supporting data services.

Terraform topology and no-break state-sync guardrails are documented in [infra/README.md](infra/README.md). Do not run Terraform state removal or apply steps for the OpenAI region sync until the live West Europe account and deployments have been imported and an operator change window is approved.

Sweden Central one-region planning is documented in [docs/infra/sweden-central-migration-plan.md](docs/infra/sweden-central-migration-plan.md), with the evidence checklist in [docs/infra/sweden-central-readiness-report.md](docs/infra/sweden-central-readiness-report.md). The migration strategy is parallel build first: do not edit `location` / `openai_location` in place against the current West Europe state key. Build Sweden Central with isolated state, validate service/SKU and Azure OpenAI quota, dark-launch, shift traffic gradually, then retire old regions under a separate zero-traffic gate.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the main quality gates:

1. **backend-tests** — installs with `uv`, runs Ruff, executes pytest with coverage threshold, exports OpenAPI, generates backend SBOM, and runs Grype
2. **frontend-build** — installs npm dependencies, runs ESLint, runs Vitest, builds Vite output, generates frontend SBOM, and runs Grype
3. **iac-validate / terraform-config-validate** — validates generated IaC artifacts and the checked-in Terraform configuration without initializing the live remote backend; Terraform setup uses `hashicorp/setup-terraform@v4`
4. **upload-sarif** — uploads Grype SARIF when available without blocking successful builds on upload rate limits
5. **deploy-backend / deploy-frontend** — production Azure Container Apps and Static Web Apps deployment from `main` using GitHub Secrets and OIDC
6. **post-deploy-smoke** — deployed frontend/API smoke checks for root, sample routes, health, and OpenAPI schema

Additional workflows:
- **security.yml** — SAST/DAST/SCA security pipeline (Semgrep, Bandit, CodeQL, Trivy, Gitleaks)
- **sbom.yml** — CycloneDX + Grype SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning
- **rollback.yml** — Blue-green deployment rollback trigger
- **monitoring.yml** — Scheduled and manual deployed health checks

### Manual Deploy (if needed)

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
az acr build --registry <acr-name> --image archmorph-api:latest .
az containerapp update --name archmorph-api --resource-group <rg> --image <acr>.azurecr.io/archmorph-api:latest

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
npx swa deploy dist --deployment-token <token> --env production
```

### Helm Chart (Self-Hosted Kubernetes)

```bash
helm install archmorph charts/archmorph/ \
  --set backend.image=<acr>.azurecr.io/archmorph-api:latest \
  --set frontend.image=<acr>.azurecr.io/archmorph-frontend:latest \
  --namespace archmorph --create-namespace
```

## Security

- **Authentication:** JWT tokens (HS256) with 1-hour expiry and in-memory revocation for admin endpoints
- **Input validation:** Pydantic models on all endpoints, prompt injection guard on AI inputs
- **Error envelope:** Structured error responses with correlation IDs, no stack trace leakage
- **Transport:** HTTPS-only with TLS 1.2+ for all Azure resources
- **Headers:** Security headers middleware (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, Permissions-Policy)
- **SVG sanitization:** DefusedXML-based sanitizer strips scripts and event handlers
- **Icon-pack write boundary:** Custom icon-pack upload/delete requires an admin bearer session from `/api/admin/login`; deployments fail closed when `ARCHMORPH_ADMIN_KEY` is missing, uploaded SVGs are sanitized, reserved built-in pack/icon IDs are blocked, built-in packs cannot be deleted, and custom icon capacity cannot evict built-in catalogs
- **IaC security scanning:** Generated Terraform/Bicep scanned for misconfigurations
- **Rate limiting:** SlowAPI rate limits on public endpoints
- **Secrets management:** All credentials via environment variables or GitHub Secrets; no secrets in code or git history
- **Dependencies:** Dependabot enabled for automated security updates, pip-audit in CI
- **SAST:** Semgrep static analysis (OWASP Top 10, security-audit, Python rules) in CI
- **Secret scanning:** Gitleaks full-history detection in CI
- **Container security:** Trivy vulnerability scanning (CRITICAL/HIGH) on every deployment
- **SBOM:** CycloneDX Bill of Materials generated for Python and npm dependencies (90-day retention)
- **WAF:** Azure Front Door Premium with OWASP CRS 3.2, Zero Trust network configuration
- **Audit logging:** Comprehensive structured JSON audit logs with risk levels, alerting rules, compliance queries
- **Feature flags:** Controlled feature rollout with percentage-based and user-targeted flags
- **Release gates:** Server-side feature gates block live scanner and deployment execution/rollback until operator-approved flags are enabled
- **Blue-green deployment:** Instant rollback capability for production deployments
- **Privacy:** Cookie consent banner, legal pages, GDPR-aware data handling
- **GPT truncation detection:** Guards against incomplete AI responses
