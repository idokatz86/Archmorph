# Archmorph

**Internal AWS/GCP → Azure migration workbench for platform & cloud engineers**

Archmorph converts AWS and GCP architecture diagrams into Azure-targeted IaC, Landing Zone designs, drift signals, and cost deltas. It exists for platform engineers and cloud engineers running migrations. It is not a product, has no customers, and ships nothing for sale.

## Mission

Archmorph is an internal engineering workbench. The value spine is:

> `diagram → vision analysis → cross-cloud mapping → IaC (Terraform/Bicep) → Azure Landing Zone → drift / cost`

Every shippable change advances that spine. Anything else is overhead and gets cut.

## Operating Principles (CTO direction, May 1, 2026)

1. **Value spine is law.** Every PR advances the spine. Anything off-spine is overhead and gets cut on sight.
2. **The user is an engineer at a terminal.** Full flow runs end-to-end in under 60 seconds. No marketing pages, no cookie banners, no sign-up modals.
3. **Every output is machine-checkable.** Mappings, IaC, ALZ SVG, drift reports — all parse, all schema-validate, all have round-trip tests.
4. **Engineering observability over product analytics.** OpenTelemetry + Application Insights. Funnel tracking, cohort retention, PostHog — banned.
5. **Identity is Entra ID. Period.** No SSO matrices, no SAML brokers, no SCIM provisioning UIs, no social auth.
6. **Single tenant, single org.** No multi-tenant primitives. Roles: `engineer | reader` via Entra group claims.
7. **Reduction beats addition.** A PR that deletes 500 LOC and preserves the spine is more valuable than one that adds 500 LOC of adjacent surface.

## Overview

Archmorph is an AI-assisted cloud migration workbench used internally to convert uploaded AWS/GCP diagrams into Azure migration artifacts: detected services, confidence-scored mappings, guided migration questions, IaC drafts, HLD exports, and cost estimates. Adjacent surfaces (scanner, deploy orchestration, drift) are present at varying maturity levels and are labeled below.

### Capability Status

Refocused around the engineer-win each capability delivers (CTO direction, May 1, 2026). **Live** = on the spine and used today. **Beta** = on the spine, hardening in progress. **Cut-candidate** = scheduled for removal in the spine consolidation PRs (PR-1 through PR-3 below).

| Capability | Status | Engineer-win it delivers |
|---|---|---|
| Diagram upload + vision analysis (PNG/PDF/Visio) | Live | Skips 10–30 min of manual draw.io re-tracing per source diagram. |
| AWS→Azure + GCP→Azure service mapping with confidence scores | Live | Removes the `aws-svc-X has no Azure equivalent — wait, what about Y?` lookup loop per migration. |
| Mapping freshness contract (`last_reviewed`) + freshness tests | Live | CI fails when a mapping row goes stale — no silent rot. |
| SKU translator with engine-correct defaults | Live | Stops mis-routing Aurora-PostgreSQL to MS SQL Hyperscale; catches license-cost surprises pre-deploy. |
| IaC chat (Terraform + Bicep) | Live | Generates IaC scaffolds from analysis without `terraform init`-then-cry loops. |
| Architecture limitations engine | Live | Fails CI on misconfigured topologies (e.g. SFTP via Front Door); 25 rules, growing to ≥40 in Phase 2. |
| HLD generator (Word export) | Live | Auto-builds the migration design doc the engineer would otherwise write by hand. |
| Drift detection vs deployed Azure | Beta | Surfaces config drift between IaC source-of-truth and live tenant. |
| Cost comparison (source cloud → Azure target) | Beta | Quantifies migration cost delta in the same artifact as the IaC plan. |
| Network topology translation (VPC/CIDR/NSG → VNet/NSG/Front Door) | Beta | Pre-validates IP plan and security groups before deploy. |
| Azure Landing Zone target SVG (8 tiers, multi-source) | Beta | Hands a starter LZ the engineer can edit, not a blank tenant. Production-ready push tracked under epic [#586](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/586). |
| RAG-grounded mapping suggestions | Live (slim target) | Mapping suggestions cite Azure docs sources — auditable, not hallucinated. |
| `azd up` / `terraform apply` orchestration | Live (slim target) | One command takes the IaC artifact to a deployed Azure RG. |
| Observability (OTel spans + 4 ALZ metrics + Workbook + alerts) | Live | Engineering-grade telemetry on the workbench itself — no PostHog. |
| GitHub IaC PR integration | Planned (P0) | Lands generated Terraform/Bicep as a PR with diff + drift comment in the engineer's repo. |
| Live cloud scanner / deploy execution / SSO/SAML/SCIM | Cut-candidate | See PR-3 below — collapses to single-tenant Entra ID. |
| `LandingPage`, `CookieBanner`, retention KPIs, product analytics, multi-tenant primitives, white-label SDK, Migration Replay, Migration Timeline, Agent PaaS PoC | Cut-candidate | Off-spine. Targeted for removal in PR-1 → PR-3 (see [Spine Consolidation Plan](#spine-consolidation-plan-cto-direction) below). |

### Spine Consolidation Plan (CTO direction)

Three deletion PRs sequenced after the already-merged Gallery → Playground → Canvas trio (#637/#638/#639, −1,637 LOC). Same pattern: highest LOC, highest conviction, fewest cross-deps first.

| Order | PR | Removes | LOC delta | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `chore: remove marketing surface` | `LandingPage.jsx` (291), `CookieBanner.jsx` (166), default-tab routing to landing, all `100% free for customers` mentions, related FE tests | ≈ −500 to −650 | Low |
| 2 | `chore: remove product analytics + retention + onboarding funnel` | `analytics.js` (145), `analytics_routes.py` (111), `retention.py`, `retention_routes.py`, Day-7 retention tile, `EVENT_TAXONOMY.md`, `posthog-js` dep, S1 PRD row | ≈ −800 to −1,100 | Medium |
| 3 | `chore: collapse multi-tenant + SSO scaffolds to single-tenant Entra ID` | `sso_routes.py` (438), `org_routes.py` (268), `profile_routes.py` (198), `feedback.py` (73), `feature_flags.py` (70), social auth providers, FE org/invite UIs, PRD §3.39 + §3.40 + §12.1. Replaces with single `Depends(verify_entra_token)` + `archmorph-engineer`/`archmorph-reader` group claims. | ≈ −1,500 to −2,000 | High — auth blast radius |

**Cumulative target:** ≈ −2,800 to −3,750 LOC across PR-1 → PR-3, on top of the −1,637 already removed. Spine surface area drops by roughly one-third with zero loss of engineer-facing capability.

### v5.0 North-Star Roadmap (8 epics)

Replaces all prior product/marketing roadmap items.

| # | Epic | Problem it solves for the engineer | Success metric |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Spine consolidation** | Repo carries ~3,000 LOC of off-spine routers and surfaces. | Net −3,000 LOC across 6 PRs; routers count drops from ~50 to ≤30. |
| 2 | **ALZ production-ready** (epic #586 → GA) | ALZ output is demo-ware (43% icon hit rate, 6/8 tiers). | Icon hit rate ≥95%; all 8 tiers populated; golden-file pixel diff <2%; gpt-5-pro grader returns `production-ready`. |
| 3 | **GitHub IaC PR integration** | Engineer copy-pastes generated IaC into a repo by hand. | One CLI/API call opens a PR in `<owner>/<repo>` with Terraform/Bicep + drift comment + ALZ SVG attached; round-trip <30s. |
| 4 | **Drift loop closure** | Drift is detected but doesn't feed back into the IaC artifact. | Drift report becomes a machine-readable patch the IaC chat can apply. |
| 5 | **Mapping coverage to 95%** | AWS→Azure + GCP→Azure mapping coverage has gaps; freshness contract incomplete. | ≥95% coverage across `aws_canonical_estate.json` + GCP equivalent; 100% rows under freshness contract. |
| 6 | **CLI-first workflow** | Web UI is the only entry. | `archmorph run --diagram x.png --target-rg foo --emit terraform,bicep,alz-svg` produces all artifacts in <60s without a browser. |
| 7 | **Architecture limitations engine Phase 2** | 25 rules with 7 known polish bugs (#620). | Phase 2 ships #620 fixes + ≥40 total rules + rule authoring docs. |
| 8 | **Observability SLOs** | Tool itself has no uptime/latency SLO. | `analyze_image` p95 <8s, `generate_landing_zone` p95 <1.5s, end-to-end p95 <30s; alerts wire to PagerDuty. |

### Production-Ready Roadmap — Azure Landing Zone (v4.3.0 target)

The post-merge CTO end-to-end review of `landing-zone-svg` (May 1, 2026) flagged the feature as **demo-ware** rather than production-ready. We're keeping it visibly Beta and shipping a 19-issue production-readiness push under epic [#586](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/586) to flip it to **Live** at end of Sprint 3:

| Track | Issues | Goal |
|-------|--------|------|
| **T2→T3 fidelity** (technical debt) | [#587](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/587)–[#594](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/594) | Fix icon registry (D1), tier mis-bucketing (D2), data-driven templates (D3), `service_connections` wiring (D4), mappings staleness, test guardrails, golden-file regression, CI freshness lint |
| **Observability + perf** | [#595](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/595), [#597](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/597) | OTel spans + metrics + alerts; SLO p95 < 1.5 s primary / < 3 s DR; Locust soak 100 RPS × 5 min |
| **Security + a11y + API** | [#596](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/596), [#598](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/598), [#599](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/599) | OWASP API Top 10 pass, WCAG 2.1 AA + screen-reader semantics, locked OpenAPI 3.1 contract + 90-day deprecation policy |
| **Frontend exposure** | [#601](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/601) (closes [#575](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/575)) | ExportHub option + `LandingZoneViewer` with DR toggle, pan/zoom, deep-link state |
| **Quality assurance** | [#600](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/600), [#604](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/604) | Golden PDF regression suite (AWS/GCP/mixed/CTO-redacted); GA gate re-runs CTO E2E with `gpt-5-pro` rubric judge |
| **Foundry model evaluation** | [#602](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/602) | Bench `gpt-5.4` / `gpt-5.5` / `gpt-5.3-codex` / `mistral-document-ai-2512` vs current `gpt-4.1` to lock per-agent model picks (model freedom granted to specialist agents) |
| **Docs + release** | [#603](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/603), [#605](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/605) | Operator-facing "What is the ALZ diagram?" doc + sample SVG fixtures; Beta → Live promotion + v4.3.0 release |

**GA gate ([#604](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/604))**: re-run the same PDF that produced the original demo-ware verdict. Pass requires icon hit rate ≥ 95%, all 8 tiers populated, ≥ 3 `service_connections` rendered, golden-file pixel diff < 2%, SLO budgets met, CISO sign-off, and `gpt-5-pro` judge returning `production-ready`. Anything less and Sprint 4 absorbs fix-forward — we don't ship.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Upload architecture diagrams (PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF, Draw.io, Visio) or import existing IaC (Terraform/ARM/CloudFormation)
- **Cloud Scanner scaffold** — AWS/Azure/GCP scan routes and wizard are present; production credential flow and provider validation still need hardening
- **Deploy scaffold** — generated IaC can be reviewed; direct deployment/rollback paths are not treated as production-ready yet
- Auto-detect AWS/GCP services with AI vision across a **405+ service catalog** (145 AWS, 143 Azure, 117 GCP — grows automatically)
- **Guided migration questions** — 32 contextual questions across 8 categories with **inter-question constraint system** that dynamically filters options based on compliance and data residency choices
- Map to Azure equivalents with **confidence scores and transparency explanations** showing why each level was assigned
- **Export architecture diagrams** as Excalidraw, Draw.io, or Visio with Azure stencils
- **Azure Landing Zone target diagram** (Beta) — pure-stdlib `landing-zone-svg` export rendering a Microsoft-style hub-and-spoke ALZ (management groups, identity hub, network hub, ingress/compute/data/observability/storage/identity tiers) plus an optional `dr_variant=dr` view with region pairing and replication bands. Multi-source provider: works for both `source_provider=aws` and `source_provider=gcp` (provider read implicitly from the analysis payload). All icons embedded as `data:` URIs — no external network calls. T3 fidelity follow-ups tracked under epic #586.
- **Interactive Architecture Map** — dagre auto-layout with confidence rings, effort badges, typed edges, zone grouping, and full pan/zoom/drag interactivity

- **Full analysis PDF report** — 6-section branded report (cover, summary, mappings, costs, risks, IaC appendix)
- **IaC Chat assistant** — interactive GPT-4o assistant for code modifications
- **Chatbot assistant** — FAQ support and GitHub issue creation with intent detection
- **Compliance mapper** — map requirements to Azure compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, FedRAMP)
- **Migration risk assessment** — risk scoring with automated runbook generation
- **Migration intelligence** — ML-powered analysis with historical pattern matching
- **Infrastructure import** — import existing Terraform/ARM/CloudFormation configurations
- **Terraform State Import** — reverse-engineer existing infrastructure from tfstate/CloudFormation/ARM into architecture diagrams
- **Multi-Cloud Cost Comparison** — side-by-side Azure vs AWS vs GCP TCO analysis with savings recommendations
- **SSO / SAML / SCIM scaffold** — enterprise auth routes exist, but require tenant-specific configuration and production validation before use
- **Real-time Collaboration** — multi-stakeholder migration workspace with share codes and role-based participants
- **Migration Replay** — animated analysis timeline for presentations with playback controls
- **Product Analytics** — funnel tracking (PostHog + backend), session-based event ingestion
- **API Developer Portal** — Swagger/Redoc integration with category overview and curl examples

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription
- Azure CLI installed
- Terraform 1.5+
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.12+

### Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
cd infra
az login
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

### Run Locally

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Docker Compose (full stack):**
```bash
docker compose up -d   # PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7 + Backend + Frontend
```

**Production-parity local guard mode:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.parity.yml up --build
```

This overlay keeps everything local, but starts the backend with production-like persistence guards:
`ENVIRONMENT=production`, `ENFORCE_POSTGRES=true`, `REQUIRE_REDIS=true`, PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`, Redis via `REDIS_URL`, and Gunicorn/Uvicorn workers instead of the reload server.

**Refresh the API contract snapshot after intentional backend route/schema changes:**
```bash
cd backend
python export_openapi.py > openapi.snapshot.json
python check_openapi_contract.py
```

### Step-by-Step Flow

```
Input (Upload / Scan / Import) → AI Analysis → Guided Questions → Collaboration → Deliverables (IaC / HLD / Cost / Deploy)
```

**Phase 1 — Input** (choose one or more entry points):
1. **Upload Diagram** — PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF, Draw.io (.drawio), or Visio (.vsdx) architecture diagram
2. **Import IaC** — Upload existing Terraform state (v3/v4), CloudFormation template, or ARM deployment JSON
3. **Cloud scan scaffold** — Connectors and credential-handling model exist, but live tenant scanning stays gated until provider validation is complete
4. **AI Vision Analysis** — GPT-4.1 detects services, connections, and annotations (with TTL cache)

**Phase 2 — Analysis** (collaborative, real-time):
6. **Guided Questions** — 8–18 contextual questions refine migration (SKU, compliance, networking, DR, security, region) with inter-question constraints
7. **Service Mappings** — Multi-cloud mappings with confidence scores and transparency explanations
8. **Dependency Graph** — Interactive React Flow canvas with 6 typed edges and dagre layout
9. **Migration Chat** — GPT-4o Q&A advisor for migration questions
10. **Collaboration** — Invite team members via share code with role-based access (architect/devops/manager/security)

**Phase 3 — Deliverables** (tabbed interface):
11. **IaC Code** — Terraform HCL, Bicep, or CloudFormation with security scanning and IaC Chat assistant
12. **HLD Document** — 13-section AI-generated design document with WAF assessment, export as DOCX/PDF/PPTX
13. **Cost Analysis** — Side-by-side Azure vs AWS vs GCP TCO with optimization recommendations
14. **Deploy scaffold** — Preview (plan/what-if) and execute paths are feature-gated and require operator review before tenant use
15. **Diagram Export** — Download as Excalidraw, Draw.io, or Visio with cloud-specific stencils
16. **PDF Report** — 6-section branded analysis report
17. **Migration Timeline** — 7-phase plan with topological dependency ordering and parallel workstreams
18. **Risk Assessment** — Risk scoring with automated runbook generation
19. **Migration Replay** — Animated timeline playback for presentations (play/pause/speed controls)

## Self-Updating Service Catalog

The service catalog automatically discovers and integrates new cloud services:

- **Daily sync** — APScheduler runs at 2:00 AM UTC, fetching from AWS Pricing Index, Azure Retail Prices API, and GCP Pricing Calculator
- **Auto-integration** — newly discovered services are written directly into the Python catalog files under an `AUTO-DISCOVERED` section
- **Fuzzy matching** — normalised comparison (name, fullName, id) prevents false-positive detections
- **Category classification** — 55 keyword hints auto-assign categories (Compute, Storage, Database, AI/ML, etc.) and matching icons
- **Dry-run mode** — CLI `--dry-run` flag detects without writing
- **Tracking** — cumulative `auto_added` counts per provider in `service_updates.json`

### CLI Usage

```bash
cd backend
python service_updater.py --run-now     # Discover + auto-add
python service_updater.py --dry-run     # Discover only (no file writes)
```

---

## Service Catalog

**405+ total services** across three providers, with 122 verified cross-cloud mappings.

### AWS → Azure (Sample)

| AWS | Azure | Confidence |
|-----|-------|------------|
| EC2 | Virtual Machines | 95% |
| S3 | Blob Storage | 95% |
| Lambda | Azure Functions | 90% |
| RDS | Azure SQL / PostgreSQL Flexible | 90% |
| DynamoDB | Cosmos DB | 85% |
| EKS | AKS | 90% |

### GCP → Azure (Sample)

| GCP | Azure | Confidence |
|-----|-------|------------|
| Compute Engine | Virtual Machines | 95% |
| Cloud Storage | Blob Storage | 95% |
| Cloud Functions | Azure Functions | 90% |
| GKE | AKS | 90% |
| BigQuery | Synapse Analytics | 80% |

Full mapping database: 405+ services across AWS, Azure, and GCP with 122 mappings.

## Architecture Limitations Engine

Deterministic rule engine that flags structurally invalid Azure compositions during analysis — for example, an SFTP client connecting to Azure Storage's SFTP endpoint **through Azure Front Door** (Front Door is HTTP/HTTPS only and cannot tunnel SSH). The diagram and Terraform would deploy cleanly; the runtime traffic would never connect.

- 25 curated rules across 7 categories (protocol, network-topology, sku-prereq, identity-auth, data-plane, region, tier-feature)
- YAML-driven rule library at [`backend/data/architecture_rules.yaml`](backend/data/architecture_rules.yaml); override via `ARCHMORPH_ARCH_RULES_PATH`
- Three severities: `blocker` (IaC will be wrong), `warning` (works but has gaps), `info` (best-practice nudges)
- IaC generation refuses with `409` when blockers exist; pass `?force=true` to override
- Full design + extensibility guide: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md)

---

## Cost Estimation

Dynamic pricing powered by the [Azure Retail Prices API](https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices):

- **Region-aware** — prices fetched per the user's selected deployment region (20 regions, default: West Europe)
- **SKU strategy multipliers** — Cost-optimized (0.65x), Balanced (1.0x), Performance-first (1.6x), Enterprise (2.2x)
- **46 service mappings** with built-in fallback estimates
- **Monthly cache** — prices cached to disk for 30 days
- **Per-service breakdown** — low/high range for each Azure service plus total monthly estimate

## Deployment

Deployment is automated through GitHub Actions from `main` to production. Keep cloud credentials and deployment values in GitHub Secrets; do not commit secrets or local `terraform.tfvars` values.

Before promoting a build, use the release checklist in [docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).

Production hardening switches:

- `DATABASE_URL` must point to PostgreSQL for production; set `ENFORCE_POSTGRES=true` to fail startup if SQLite is accidentally configured.
- `REDIS_HOST` or `REDIS_URL` should be configured for horizontal scale; set `REQUIRE_REDIS=true` to fail startup instead of falling back to local file-backed stores.
- `FEATURE_FLAG_LIVE_CLOUD_SCANNER`, `FEATURE_FLAG_DEPLOY_ENGINE`, and `FEATURE_FLAG_ENTERPRISE_SSO_SCIM` default to disabled and must only be enabled after the admin release gate and tenant validation pass.
- No customer billing or subscription setup is required; Archmorph is free for customers.

### Azure Resources

| Resource | SKU | Region |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Container Apps (`archmorph-api`, `archmorph-mcp-gateway`) | Consumption | West Europe |
| Static Web Apps | Free | West Europe |
| Container Registry (`archmorphacm7pd`) | Basic | West Europe |
| Azure OpenAI | S0 | East US [^1] |
| PostgreSQL Flexible Server | Burstable B1ms | West Europe |
| Azure Cache for Redis | Basic C0 | West Europe |
| Application Insights | — | West Europe |

[^1]: Tracked for consolidation into West Europe — see [#607](https://github.com/idokatz86/Archmorph/issues/607). The April 2026 hub used to also run an `archmorph-backend` App Service (Canada Central), a duplicate `cafd43cfd4deacr` registry (East US), and a stray `secondnature-openai-whisper` cognitive account. All three were retired during the May 2026 infra consolidation; the dev RG now hosts only the active Container Apps stack and supporting data services.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the main quality gates:

1. **backend-tests** — installs with `uv`, runs Ruff, executes pytest with coverage threshold, exports OpenAPI, generates backend SBOM, and runs Grype
2. **frontend-build** — installs npm dependencies, runs ESLint, runs Vitest, builds Vite output, generates frontend SBOM, and runs Grype
3. **upload-sarif** — uploads Grype SARIF when available without blocking successful builds on upload rate limits
4. **deploy-backend / deploy-frontend** — production Azure Container Apps and Static Web Apps deployment from `main` using GitHub Secrets and OIDC
5. **post-deploy-smoke** — deployed frontend/API smoke checks for root, sample routes, health, and OpenAPI schema

Additional workflows:
- **security.yml** — SAST/DAST/SCA security pipeline (Semgrep, Bandit, CodeQL, Trivy, Gitleaks)
- **sbom.yml** — CycloneDX + Grype SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning
- **rollback.yml** — Blue-green deployment rollback trigger
- **monitoring.yml** — Scheduled and manual deployed health checks

### Manual Deploy (if needed)

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
az acr build --registry <acr-name> --image archmorph-api:latest .
az containerapp update --name archmorph-api --resource-group <rg> --image <acr>.azurecr.io/archmorph-api:latest

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
npx swa deploy dist --deployment-token <token> --env production
```

### Helm Chart (Self-Hosted Kubernetes)

```bash
helm install archmorph charts/archmorph/ \
  --set backend.image=<acr>.azurecr.io/archmorph-api:latest \
  --set frontend.image=<acr>.azurecr.io/archmorph-frontend:latest \
  --namespace archmorph --create-namespace
```
